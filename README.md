Janky app to generate protein scale graphs, and probably more stuff later.\
Feel free to PR.

## Features:
- Runs in Browser/ Static Site

- Not much else really...

## Feature Backlog:
- Responsive Graphs
- Interactive Graphs
- Graph Export
- Data Export
- Scales other than K-D Hydrophobicity
- Integration with UniProt, etc
- File "Upload"
- Webassembly and SIMD/ C bindings (might require architechtural change)
